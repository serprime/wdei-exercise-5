WebDataExtraction- Exercise 5 - String and Tree Similarity

Both applications have a jUnit test that can be used to develop by example.

String similarity
---------------
Project in folder string-similarity.

### 
- added reading strings from a file (30 strings)
- added calculation of Levenshtein distance in addition to Jaro
- added calculation of precision and recall (for both algorithms and for both thresholds)
- added writing all the data to a spreadsheet


Tree similarity
-------------
Project in folder tree-similarity.

Currently it is just the default STM from the slides.

### Todo:
- Add main() to start from command line with file names as parameters to read the html trees
- Add additional heuristic/metric
